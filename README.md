## Project 2: Stock Portfolio Forecasting and Optimization on S&P500 Using Machine Learning and Search Methods (2024/2025)

### Introduction
This project explores **time series forecasting** techniques and **optimization methods** to design an efficient investment strategy for S&P500 stock data. Leveraging classical machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) and deep learning methods (e.g., LSTM, MLP), the goal is to predict stock behavior and optimize portfolio selection using search techniques like **Monte Carlo simulations** or **genetic algorithms**, aiming to maximize return over a one-month horizon.

### Context
The stock market's volatility presents a significant challenge in forecasting prices and optimizing portfolios. This project combines **data-driven forecasts** with **optimization techniques**, providing solutions to real-world financial problems:
- **Forecasting:** Predicting future stock prices using advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Optimization:** Selecting the best stock portfolio to maximize returns or minimize risks.

#### Related Works
Some relevant studies include:
- **Machine Learning for Stock Prediction:**  
  - Patel et al. (2015) combined Random Forest and SVM for high-accuracy stock movement predictions.  
  - Bao et al. (2017) demonstrated LSTMs' ability to model financial time series effectively.  
- **Portfolio Optimization:**  
  - Glasserman (2003) highlighted Monte Carlo methods for simulating asset prices.  
  - Lin and Gen (2007) showcased genetic algorithms for solving complex portfolio optimization problems.

### Dataset: S&P500
Historical stock data from the S&P500 index (2010â€“2023) is utilized, including:
- **Daily metrics:** Opening price, closing price, trading volume, and technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, volatility).  
The model's performance is evaluated using unseen data from January 2024.
